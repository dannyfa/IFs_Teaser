My name is Daniela de Albuquerque and I am a MD-PhD trainee at Duke University, currently pursuing my PhD in 
Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at [John Pearson's lab](https://pearsonlab.github.io/about.html). I am broadly interested 
in deep generative models (e.g., Variational Auto-Encoders, Diffusions, Flow Matching) and in developing new
models tailored towards addressing specific needs/problems in neuroscience and biomedical research. To learn a bit more 
about my other projects, please visit my personal website. 

On the medicine front, I am interested in pursuing Radiology as my future specialty and in applying my PhD training towards
developing new models capable of facilitating clinical diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric, neurological, and neurodevelopmental
diseases using biomedical imaging data (e.g., brain CT, MRI, fMRI). I am also a proud Brazilian, 
and love surfing, traveling, and (above all) cats! 

Finally, I've been fortunate to be supported throughout my training by both the Ruth L. Kirschstein Pre-Doctoral National Research 
Servive Award (NIMH F30MH129086) and by Duke's T32 (MSTP) grant.

<!--- I am also passionate about teaching
coding and basic computer science skills to young kids using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/about).  If you are also passionate 

about teaching tech/CS to kids and would like to get involved, please check the webpage for our 
Creative Coding Program in partnership with [C.C. Spaulding Elementary School](https://www.dpsnc.net/CC-Spaulding) at Durham. We are currently looking for 
motivated volunteers to help us out!--->
